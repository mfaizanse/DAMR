# Human Pose Estimation

This is the Human Pose Estimation module. It is based on the work of [Daniil-Osokin](https://github.com/Daniil-Osokin/lightweight-human-pose-estimation.pytorch). For a quick demo the [demo file](demo.py) can be executed. It can be integrated by importing the PoseEstimator class. The network is fetched via git-lfs so make sure you set it up correctly.
